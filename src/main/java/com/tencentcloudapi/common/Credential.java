 * Credential has many types in Tencent Cloud Access Management service.

 * <p>Permanent credential: SecretId & SecretKey, can only be obtained from Tencent Cloud Management
 * Console, https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cam/capi.
 *
 * <p>Ephemeral credential, can be obtained from Security Token Service (STS), has three dimensions:
 * SecretId, SecretKey and Token. It will expire after a short time, hence you need to invoke STS
 * API to refresh it.
